Things that I would do if I had more time

1)

It’s really cool that we can mix Foundation (NS-) types and Swift native types, but in my own production code I’m trying to keep things as native as possible.  I’d love to get rid of the [NSDictionary] picture array and make it totally native.

2)

Put everything into Core Data to make it somewhat persistent and available off-line.

3)

I can think of a few Unit / XCTests that I could possibly do, but I ran out of time to work these up.
